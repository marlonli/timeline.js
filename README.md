# timeline.js
A JavaScript library based on D3.js, with draggable visualization thumbnail window and updated data visualization.

## How to use
1. Download this library to your project.
2. Include timeline.js into your project.
3. Create a div element in html.
4. In your JavaScript, create a timeline object e.g., timelineObj and pass div's DOM to timelineObj.
5. call timelineObj.draw(your data).

This is only a fundamental JS library, there are some bugs remained, I didn't put any css into it. If you have any good idea, you're welcome to contribute to this library! ðŸ˜ƒ
